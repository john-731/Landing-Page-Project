# Landing-Page-Project
The landing page project creates a page with multiple sections that automatically uses Javascript to create a navigation bar adding the page's sections to it. Whenever a section is pressed in the navigation bar, the page should smoothly scroll down to that section. Also, the section that is in view should be highlighted using CSS stylistic features.
