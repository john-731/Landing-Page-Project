# Landing-Page-Project

## Description
The landing page project creates a page with multiple sections that automatically uses Javascript to create a navigation bar adding the page's sections to it. Whenever a section is pressed in the navigation bar, the page should smoothly scroll down to that section. Also, the section that is in view should be highlighted using CSS stylistic features.


## Usage Instructions
You will need to have a web-interpreting program such as Visual Studio Code to add the HTML, CSS, and Javascript codes and interpret them. Also, you will need a browser to open the HTML file.

## Credits
The HTML and CSS files in this project were made by Udacity and edited by me, and the Javascript code was written by me.
